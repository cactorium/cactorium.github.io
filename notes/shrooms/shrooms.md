# Overall process
spores -> mycelium on agar -> grain -> bulk

The agar step allows you to be selective, picking the mushroom strains that look healthiest.
Mushroom spores are like apple seeds, they generally don't match their parent's genetics, so the agar stage gives you a chance to select for better mushroom strains.
The mycelium is generally a huge mix of genetics, a lot of different specimens with different genetics growing together to form the overall mass.
You can select at the agar stage to reduce the diversity of the mycelium to a single strain, although I don't know what benefits there are to that.

spores -> agar -> culture -> grain -> bulk

## Grain jar recipes

Millet:
- Following the recipe [https://www.reddit.com/r/MushroomGrowers/comments/wuwpt9/technique_no_soak_no_simmer_millet_tek/](here)
- 220 g millet, 154 g water
- immediately PC for 90 minutes
- (optional) shake up afterwards by banging against a bike tire


## Agar recipes

## Substrate
A mix of grass, hardwood pellets, and hardwood chips

Grass (alfalfa straw) by itself gives a pretty good flavor, the yield tends to be pretty poor though

Trying a mix of all three of them now, I'm hoping the grass provides channels that can easily be colonized to help the mycelium penetrate into the hardwood bits

Cold water lime pasteurization in 5 gallon buckets is the easiest method I've found, it's fairly easy to dump solution afterwards down the toilet, about 30 g of calcium hydroxide in a 5 gallon bucket


## Sterile protocol

## Lab environment setup

## Other
15/64in or 1/4in drill bit for the grain jar insertion ports I've chosen
