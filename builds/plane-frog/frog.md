# New frog wedge for a block plane
I've had this old block plane that didn't have a frog.
The frog sits in the throat of the plane (side note: that's why it's called that), and supports the plane blade to reduce the chatter that happens while the plane is cutting.
The plane can work without it, but adding a new one should improve how it performs, and the added mass will probably help as well.
Also, there's a crack forming on the bottom of the plane, and I'm hoping the frog should spread the tension holding the blade against the sole of the plane and stop it from spreading until I get around to properly repairing it.
